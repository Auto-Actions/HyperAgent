## Programming Language

Python

## Original Requirements

Create a fastAPI server which can be launch by uvicorn. The server will contain REST APIs allow user send a request within a requirement and a github repository address and then the server will use MetaGPT to create the program following that requirement and push it to that github repository address. Make sure that using .env to store any secret tokens

## Project Name

fastapi_metagpt_integration

## Product Goals

- Ensure seamless integration with GitHub for code pushes
- Provide a user-friendly API interface for submitting requirements
- Securely handle secret tokens and sensitive information

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to easily submit my project requirements and GitHub repository via API
- As a user, I want to ensure my secret tokens are securely handled and not exposed
- As a developer, I want to receive feedback if my submission is successful or if there were any errors

## Competitive Analysis

- GitHub Copilot: Offers AI-powered code suggestions but lacks custom project generation
- GitLab Auto DevOps: Provides comprehensive CI/CD but does not offer AI code generation
- SourceAI: AI code generation tool but lacks direct GitHub integration for pushing code
- DeepCode: Offers code review powered by AI but does not generate new code based on requirements
- Codex by OpenAI: Powerful AI code generator but requires manual integration for code pushes to repositories

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires building a FastAPI server capable of receiving user inputs, including project requirements and GitHub repository details. It must then use an AI, specifically MetaGPT, to generate code based on these requirements and push the generated code to the specified GitHub repository. Security is paramount, with .env files used for storing secret tokens.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement FastAPI server with endpoints for receiving project requirements and GitHub repository details']
- ['P0', 'Integrate MetaGPT for AI-powered code generation based on user-submitted requirements']
- ['P0', 'Secure handling and storage of secret tokens using .env files']
- ['P1', 'Provide detailed error messages and success feedback to the user']
- ['P2', 'Implement logging for tracking requests and generated code pushes']

## UI Design draft

The project primarily focuses on backend functionalities with minimal UI requirements. A simple Swagger UI generated by FastAPI for testing and interacting with the API endpoints will suffice.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific capabilities and limitations of MetaGPT in terms of code generation complexity and language support.
