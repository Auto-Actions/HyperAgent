{"Implementation approach":"We will build a FastAPI server that leverages the uvicorn ASGI server for deployment. The server will expose REST APIs to accept project requirements and GitHub repository details from users. We will integrate MetaGPT for AI-powered code generation and use the GitHub API for pushing generated code to user-specified repositories. Secret tokens and sensitive information will be managed securely using .env files. For simplicity and efficiency, we'll use python-dotenv for .env file management, FastAPI for the web framework, httpx for asynchronous HTTP requests (for GitHub API interactions), and a hypothetical MetaGPT Python library for AI code generation.","File list":["main.py","config.py",".env","requirements.txt","github_integration.py","metagpt_integration.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class FastAPIServer {\n        +uvicorn_server() void\n        +api_endpoints() void\n    }\n    class GitHubIntegration {\n        -token str\n        +push_code(repository: str, code: str) bool\n    }\n    class MetaGPTIntegration {\n        +generate_code(requirements: str) str\n    }\n    class Config {\n        +load_env() dict\n    }\n    FastAPIServer --> GitHubIntegration : uses\n    FastAPIServer --> MetaGPTIntegration : uses\n    FastAPIServer --> Config : uses\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant FS as FastAPIServer\n    participant GI as GitHubIntegration\n    participant MI as MetaGPTIntegration\n    participant C as Config\n    FS->>C: load_env()\n    C-->>FS: return config\n    FS->>FS: api_endpoints()\n    FS->>MI: generate_code(requirements)\n    MI-->>FS: return code\n    FS->>GI: push_code(repository, code)\n    GI-->>FS: return success\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the specific capabilities and limitations of MetaGPT in terms of code generation complexity and language support.
